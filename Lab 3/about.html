  <h1 class="header">Hello There!</h1>
  <p>I'm a 4th year Computer Science and Engineering student at UC Merced. 
    I'm especially interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    In my last internship I actually worked on creating a model to be used in text
    prediction. I actively continue to learn more topics within the field and love expanding
    my knowledge. My other hobbies are watching Netflix occassionally some Youtube and 
    spending time with friends and family. I am also a big fan of cars and you can catch me always looking
    up cars. Here's a short video of me having some fun in my car:
